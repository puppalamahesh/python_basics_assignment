        "\n",
        "The F-test is a statistical test used to compare the variances of two or more groups. It is primarily used in ANOVA (Analysis of Variance) and other contexts, such as testing the overall significance of a regression model. The test examines whether the variances between the groups are significantly different, which can indicate whether the group means are likely to be different from each other.\n",
        "\n",
        "In the context of hypothesis testing, the F-test assesses whether the variability between groups (or models) is greater than the variability within groups (or models). A large value of the F-statistic suggests that the observed variation between groups is greater than would be expected due to random chance, leading to the rejection of the null hypothesis.\n",

        "**Relation of the F-test to Hypothesis Testing:**\n",
        "\n",
        "The F-test is used as a tool in hypothesis testing to determine whether the variance between groups is significantly greater than the variance within groups. This helps determine if the observed differences between the groups are statistically significant, indicating that at least one group mean is different from the others.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Key Points to Remember:**\n",
        "\n",
        "The F-test is not about testing individual differences between pairs of groups (like a t-test), but rather about testing if there are any differences in the means across multiple groups.\n",
        "\n",
        "The result of the F-test gives an F-statistic, which is compared to a critical value from the F-distribution.\n",
        "\n",
        "If the F-statistic is large, it suggests that the between-group variability is large relative to the within-group variability, which would support the rejection of the null hypothesis.\n",
